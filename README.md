spacegame
=========

Some sort of fusion of Space Invaders and Asteroids

This project is mainly to get me used to transforming, scaling, rotating, etc. for future "high-res" games and 3D games using Graphics2D and LWJGL. Could also be part of those future games as a minigame sort of.

You may use this in your work as long as you do not earn mony with it and as long as you credit me.
